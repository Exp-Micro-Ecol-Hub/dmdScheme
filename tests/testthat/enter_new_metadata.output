Trying to open the file '/Users/rainer/Documents/Projects/DataManagementAndStrategy/dmdScheme/inst/googlesheet/dmdScheme.xlsx'... 

The template should have opened in Excel.
If Excel is not in the foreground, it might have opened in the background.
Depending on the browser, the file might have been downloaded to the efault download location.
If nothing happened either, you can open the file directly in Excel from
          /Users/rainer/Documents/Projects/DataManagementAndStrategy/dmdScheme/inst/googlesheet/dmdScheme.xlsx

In this case, please file a bug report at
          https://github.com/Exp-Micro-Ecol-Hub/dmdScheme/issues
and provide
     - Operating System and version
     - Default browser
     - file location

Thanks.
