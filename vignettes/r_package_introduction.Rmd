# The R Package

The package `dmdScheme` is a base package for the usage and development of domain specific metadata schemes. It provides functionality to enter the metadata, validate the entered metadata, and export it to xml format for further processing by e.g. archival repositories. This document will give an overview over the `dmdScheme` package and what it contains. More detailed information about the development, including a suggested workflow, can be found in the vignette **Howto create a new scheme**.

# Install the package `dmdScheme`
In most cases, when you read this, you already have installed the package `dmdScheme`. If not there are three ways to install it:

1. via CRAN
This will install the last stable version.
It is momentarily not possible, as the package is not yet released on CRAN.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("dmdScheme")
```


2. via github
This will install the last development version.
The development of this package is hosted on [github](https://github.com/rkrug/dmdScheme). You can also install from there. This will give you the most recent version in development. You can also choose different branches to install. Please see the documentation of the [remotes package](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes) for details.

```{r eval = FALSE}
## install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Exp-Micro-Ecol-Hub/dmdScheme", ref = "master", build_opts = "build_vignettes = TRUE")
```

There are three different versions available:

- **CRAN** For general uasage, we recommend to use the CRAN package distribution for production usage. 
- **github `ref = "master"** The github version from the master branch (`ref = "master`) is the stable branch and will become over time the next CRAN release. You can use this if you want to try (or need) the newest features. It should be stable.
- **github `ref = "dev"** The bleeding edge version. This is the one with the newest features which possibly includes non-stable versions. If you can live with crashes, you can use this version. But be warned: errors will occur, and features will change without notice. This is not recommended for production usage.


# Managing installed schemes

To load the package, you have to run

```{r}
library("dmdScheme")
```

This will load the package and use the default scheme definition.

There are several commands to manage installed schemes. All these commands start with `scheme_`.

These are in detail:

## **`scheme_default()`**
returns the default scheme and version, i.e. the one with which the dmdScheme package is based. This can be the `dmdScheme` package itself, or a package crewated with `make_new_package()`.

```{r}
scheme_default()
```

## **`scheme_install()`**
Install a new scheme definition. In the normal usecase, this function uses `scheme_download_url()` to download the scheme defintion from the default [github repository](https://github.com/Exp-Micro-Ecol-Hub/dmdSchemeRepository) and installs it. The usage is

```{r}
scheme_install(name = "emeScheme", version = "0.9.5")
```


## **`scheme_list()`**
Shows the installed schemes.
```{r}
scheme_list()
```

## **`scheme_use()`**
Activate the scheme `NAME` with version `VERSION`

```{r}
scheme_use(name = "emeScheme", version = "0.9.5")
```

## **`scheme_active()`** 
Shows the currently active scheme.

```{r}
scheme_active()
scheme_use(name = "dmdScheme", version = "0.9.5")
scheme_active()
```


## **`scheme_uninstall()`**
Uninstall an installed scheme. The scheme definition, is deleted from the scheme library, and moved to a temporary flder which wil be deleted at the end of the R session.
```{r}
scheme_uninstall(name = "emeScheme", version = "0.9.5")

```

## **`scheme_path_xlsx()`**
Returns the path to the `.xlsx` representation of the currently active scheme.
```{r}
scheme_path_xlsx()
```

## **`scheme_path_xml()`**
Returns the path to the `.xml` representation of the currently active scheme.
```{r}
scheme_path_xml()
```

## **`scheme_make()`**
This function is used to package a new scheme. For details see the vignette `Howto Create a new scheme`.

# Entering new Metadata

To enter new data to the dmdScheme, you have to run the command

```{r eval = FALSE}
open_new_spreadsheet()
```

This will open Excel and the file should look similar to this, when looking at the second tab:

![](./figs/enter_new_data.png)

The following points are important to remember:

1) The file is saved in a **temporary** directory. It needs to be saved at a different location, if you want to keep the changes.
2) Data can only be entered in the green cells with. All other cells are write protected.

After entering the data, save it to a location for further processing.


## Validating your metadata

The metadata in the spreadsheet can be validated by using

```{r eval = FALSE}
val <- validate( scheme_path_xlsx() )
```

which results in an object of class `dmdScheme_validation`.

To create a report (html, pdf or docx) yo can use the `report()` function:

```{r eval = FALSE}
report(val)
```

which will open a html report in your browser.

## Converting Metadata to xml

You can export the data to an an xml file:

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- read_excel( scheme_path_xlsx() )
as_xml( x )
```

When you specify the argument `file`, the xml will be saved:

```{r eval = FALSE}
xmlFile = tempfile(fileext = ".xml")
x <- read_excel( scheme_path_xlsx() )
write_xml( x = x, file = xmlFile )
```

## Re-import from xml into R

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- read_xml( xmlFile )
x
```

## Importing Data from Excel Sheet

Next, you have to import the data entered in the Excel sheet into R. For simplicity, we use here a file included in the package. If you want to load your own file, replace `scheme_path_xlsx()` with the file name and path to that file.

```{r}
x <- read_excel(
      file = scheme_path_xlsx(),
      verbose = TRUE
)
```

The `verbose = TRUE` argument will produce messages which will show you what is happening and will help to identify problems.

## Print dmdScheme Data

`dmdScheme` Data can be printed by using the `print()` function. The function has three arguments which control the printout:

* `printAttr`: if `TRUE` (default) print the **basic** attributes prefixed with `A   `
* `printExAttr`: if `TRUE` print the **all** attributes prefixed with `X   `
* `printData`: if `TRUE` (default) print the data prefixed with `D   `

```{r}
print(
  x,
  printAttr = FALSE,
  printExtAttr = FALSE,
  printData = FALSE
)
```

```{r}
print(
  x,
  printAttr = TRUE,
  printExtAttr = FALSE,
  printData = FALSE
)
```

```{r}
print(
  x,
  printAttr = TRUE,
  printExtAttr = TRUE,
  printData = FALSE
)
```

```{r}
print(
  x,
  printAttr = TRUE,
  printExtAttr = TRUE,
  printData = TRUE
)
```


## General things

The `dmdScheme` data in R can be also saved, loaded, and edited using the standard R commands.
