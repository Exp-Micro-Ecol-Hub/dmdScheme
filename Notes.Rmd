# Metadata "properties"
on [CEDAR](https://metadatacenter.org/tools-training/cedar-template-tools) they outline the properties of theitr metadata fields:

- recommended name == `valueProperty`
- type == `type`
- description == `Description`
- link to one or more semantic concepts == **not included (yet?)**
- constraints on the accepted values == `allowedValues` and `suggestedValues`

We are mainly providoing the information included in their layouts which should make it possible to create ontologiesd using e.g. OWL.
