# Introduction

This scheme will provide a framework for describing aquatic microcosm experiments in the sense as used in the papers in the [Reference] section.

This scheme **aims to** cover the following aspects:

1. **Materials**: these include instrumentation, species, cultures, ...
1. **Initialization**: run in time, treatment, conditions
2. **Conditions / Manipulations**: different conditions for the different treatments and manipulations, conditions, transplantations, ...
3. **Sampling** (how much is taken from microcosms and how much is re-filled with what and how often, ...)
3. **Measuring** of the raw data (video, images, count, ...) using different methodologies and their instrumentations, protocols, ...
4. **Extraction** of the needed measure  (density, ...) from the measured raw data (if needed) and the software, versions, parameter used (e.b. bemovi)

By using this metadata one should be able to successfully re-generate the data.

This scheme **does not** aim to cover aspects of the actual analysis of this data with the aim of answering specific questions.

# Experimental Microbial Ecology Protocols
In the  [supplement to their paper](https://emeh-protocols.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to their paper, @altermatt_big_2015 specify the following sections for a protocoll. The sections are as followed:

```
1. Materials
1.1 Species used
1.2 Culture medium
1.3 Bacteria
1.4 Apparatus
1.5 Lab practices
1.6 Long term maintenance
1.7 Long term preservation
2. Measurements
2.1 Sampling
2.2 Microscopy
2.3 Image analysis
2.4 Particle counter
2.5 Bacterial density
2.6 Raman microspectroscopy
2.7 Barcoding
2.8 Ge-, prote- and epigenomics
2.9 Respirometry
2.10 Nutrients and decomposition
2.11 Protocol unavailable
2.12 Interactions
3. Manipulations
3.1 Protocol unavailable
3.2 Density
3.3 Disturbance
3.4 Nutrients and viscosity
3.5 Spatial structure
3.6 temperature
3.7 Biotic environment
```

We use these sections as a starting point to define a metadata scheme to describe the microcosm experiment. 

# The emeScheme

The sections in the [Experimental Microbial Ecology Protocols] were supplemented and assessed by reviewing the methods in the papers in the [References] section below.

This document was than re-ordered and thinned which resulted in the initial verions of [the Google Doc Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OAyRM1jGL5Vho-YfPffePhwGpQtaBUeTPJV6P98f0Bc).

Here we describe the different properties of the emeScheme We will start at the first level and go deeper into the different properties.

The working copy can be found on a [Google Doc Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OAyRM1jGL5Vho-YfPffePhwGpQtaBUeTPJV6P98f0Bc). 

## Current Structure

The names of the properties folow the following convention:

* Properties in starting with a **capital letters** (in **<span style="text-decoration:underline; color: blue" >Blue</span>**) are **property sets**, containing sub-properties
* Properties starting with a **small letter** (in **<span style="color:black">black</span>**) are **value properties**, containing values of the types **character** or **numeric**. 

* **<span style="color:red">Specify types for each value property </span>**
* **<span style="color:red">Include repeatable, ...</span>**

The structure as at **`r read.dcf(here("DESCRIPTION"))[1, "GSUpdate"]` GMT** is as followed:

```{r structure}
caption <- "emeScheme Properties. <span style=\'font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline; color: blue;\' >Blue</span> properties are property sets, i.e. contain other properties, **<span style='color:black'>black</span>** properties are value properties which contain values."

options(knitr.kable.NA = '')

dat <- emeScheme
names(dat) <- gsub(" ", "_", names(dat))

propColor <- function( x ) {
  fc <- substr(x, 1, 1)
  col <- ifelse( 
    fc == tolower(fc), 
    "black", 
    "blue"
  )
  underl <- ifelse( 
    fc == tolower(fc), 
    FALSE, 
    TRUE
  )
  bold <- ifelse( 
    fc == tolower(fc), 
    FALSE, 
    TRUE
  )
  sel <- !is.na(x)
  x[sel] <- cell_spec( 
    x         = x[sel], 
    color     = col[sel],
    bold     = bold[sel],
    underline = underl[sel]
  )
  return(x)
}

dat %>% 
  mutate(
    Property_Level_1 = propColor(Property_Level_1 ),
    Property_Level_2 = propColor(Property_Level_2 ),
    Property_Level_3 = propColor(Property_Level_3 ),
    Property_Level_4 = propColor(Property_Level_4 ),
    Property_Level_5 = propColor(Property_Level_5 )
  ) %>%
  knitr::kable(
    escape = FALSE,
    format = "html",
    caption = caption
  )  %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "bordered"), 
    full_width = FALSE
  )
```

# From Project to Dataset - how the emeScheme fits in

Data can be separated into different classes. Each of these classes sontains of **one** (data) file and **one** metadata file. 

These metadata files contain in the property **RelatedIdentifier** providing the possibility to link different (meta)data sets.
