# Experimental Microbial Ecology Protocols
In the  [supplement to their paper](https://emeh-protocols.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to their paper, @altermatt_big_2015 specify the following sections for a protocoll. The sections are as followed:

```
1. Materials
1.1 Species used
1.2 Culture medium
1.3 Bacteria
1.4 Apparatus
1.5 Lab practices
1.6 Long term maintenance
1.7 Long term preservation
2. Measurements
2.1 Sampling
2.2 Microscopy
2.3 Image analysis
2.4 Particle counter
2.5 Bacterial density
2.6 Raman microspectroscopy
2.7 Barcoding
2.8 Ge-, prote- and epigenomics
2.9 Respirometry
2.10 Nutrients and decomposition
2.11 Protocol unavailable
2.12 Interactions
3. Manipulations
3.1 Protocol unavailable
3.2 Density
3.3 Disturbance
3.4 Nutrients and viscosity
3.5 Spatial structure
3.6 temperature
3.7 Biotic environment
```

We use these sections as a starting point to define a metadata scheme to describe the microcosm experiment. The sections are supplemented byn evaluating the papers in the [References] section below.
