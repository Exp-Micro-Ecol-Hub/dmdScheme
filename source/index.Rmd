# Introduction

This scheme will provide a framework for describing aquatic microcosm experiments in the sense as used in the papers in the [References] section.

This scheme **aims to** cover the following aspects:

1. **Materials**: these include instrumentation, species, cultures, ...
1. **Initialization**: run in time, treatment, conditions
2. **Conditions / Manipulations**: different conditions for the different treatments and manipulations, conditions, transplantations, ...
3. **Sampling** (how much is taken from microcosms and how much is re-filled with what and how often, ...)
3. **Measuring** of the raw data (video, images, count, ...) using different methodologies and their instrumentations, protocols, ...
4. **Extraction** of the needed measure  (density, ...) from the measured raw data (if needed) and the software, versions, parameter used (e.b. bemovi)

By using this metadata one should be able to successfully re-generate the data.

This scheme **does not** aim to cover aspects of the actual analysis of this data with the aim of answering specific questions.

# Experimental Microbial Ecology Protocols
In the  [supplement to their paper](https://emeh-protocols.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to their paper, @altermatt_big_2015 specify the following sections for a protocoll. The sections are as followed:

```
1. Materials
1.1 Species used
1.2 Culture medium
1.3 Bacteria
1.4 Apparatus
1.5 Lab practices
1.6 Long term maintenance
1.7 Long term preservation
2. Measurements
2.1 Sampling
2.2 Microscopy
2.3 Image analysis
2.4 Particle counter
2.5 Bacterial density
2.6 Raman microspectroscopy
2.7 Barcoding
2.8 Ge-, prote- and epigenomics
2.9 Respirometry
2.10 Nutrients and decomposition
2.11 Protocol unavailable
2.12 Interactions
3. Manipulations
3.1 Protocol unavailable
3.2 Density
3.3 Disturbance
3.4 Nutrients and viscosity
3.5 Spatial structure
3.6 temperature
3.7 Biotic environment
```

We use these sections as a starting point to define a metadata scheme to describe the microcosm experiment.

# The emeScheme

The sections in the [Experimental Microbial Ecology Protocols] were supplemented and assessed by reviewing the methods in the papers in the [References] section below.

This document was than re-ordered and thinned which resulted in the initial verions of [the Google Doc Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OAyRM1jGL5Vho-YfPffePhwGpQtaBUeTPJV6P98f0Bc).

Here we describe the different properties of the emeScheme We will start at the first level and go deeper into the different properties.

The working copy can be found on a [Google Doc Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OAyRM1jGL5Vho-YfPffePhwGpQtaBUeTPJV6P98f0Bc). 

## Current Structure

The properties follow these conventions:

* Properties in starting with a **capital letters** (in **<span style="text-decoration:underline; color: blue" >Blue</span>**) are **property sets**, containing either other property sets or other value properties, but not both. 
* Properties starting with a **small letter** (in **<span style="color:black">black</span>**) are **value properties**, containing values. They follow the format **PropertyName (unit) [type]**.
  * **Unit** is the unit of the value (e.g. l, rpm, ...)
  * **type** is the type of the value. Possible values are **integer**, **numeric**, **logical**, and, the default, **character**. This is used as the data type in R.
  * all **value properties** in one **property set** have to have the same number of entries, separated by a comma.
  * in some **value properties** several entries belong together and are considered one meta data point (e.g. **parameterUsed** in **VideoAnalysis**. These entries are separated by a semicolon, and will **only** be split during the export ot the xml file.
* No properties are mandatory!
* Some properties are repeatable **<span style="color:red">TODO: Needs to be specified!</span>**

  
  
A **property set** which contains **value properties** must be seen as tables and must therefore have the same number of entries for each value property.

The structure as at **`r read.dcf(here("DESCRIPTION"))[1, "GSUpdate"]` GMT** is as followed:

```{r structure}
caption <- "emeScheme Properties. '**PropertyName (unit) [field type in R]**'. <span style=\'font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline; color: blue;\' >Blue</span> properties are property sets, i.e. contain value properties or property sets, **<span style='color:black'>black</span>** properties are value properties which contain values. The <span style=\'font-weight: bold; text-decoration:underline; color: yellow;\' >yellow column</span> is an example for the data."

options(knitr.kable.NA = '')

propColor <- function( x ) {
  fc <- substr(x, 1, 1)
  col <- ifelse( 
    fc == tolower(fc), 
    "black", 
    "blue"
  )
  underl <- ifelse( 
    fc == tolower(fc), 
    FALSE, 
    TRUE
  )
  bold <- ifelse( 
    fc == tolower(fc), 
    FALSE, 
    TRUE
  )
  sel <- !is.na(x)
  x[sel] <- cell_spec( 
    x         = x[sel], 
    color     = col[sel],
    bold     = bold[sel],
    underline = underl[sel]
  )
  return(x)
}

emeScheme_gd %>% 
  mutate_at( vars(starts_with("Property")), propColor ) %>%
  knitr::kable(
    escape = FALSE,
    format = "html",
    caption = caption
  )  %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "bordered"), 
    full_width = FALSE
  ) %>%
  column_spec(ncol(emeScheme_gd), width = "30em", background = "yellow")
```

## Example emeScheme Data

the package contains exapmle data which can be used as followed:

```{r}
x <- addDataToEmeScheme()
```

### Print emeScheme Data

emeScheme Data can be printed by using the `print()` function. The function has two arguments which control the printout, i.e. `printAttr` and `printData`.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
print(
  x,
  printAttr = FALSE,
  printExtAttr = FALSE,
  printData = FALSE
)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
print(
  x,
  printAttr = TRUE,
  printExtAttr = FALSE,
  printData = FALSE
)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
print(
  x,
  printAttr = TRUE,
  printExtAttr = TRUE,
  printData = FALSE
)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
print(
  x,
  printAttr = TRUE,
  printExtAttr = TRUE,
  printData = TRUE
)
```

### Exported as xml
The example data in the yellow column looks exported to xml as followed:

```{r example_export_xml, echo=FALSE}
emeScheme_gd %>%
  addDataToEmeScheme() %>%
  emeSchemeToXml( ta = "ExampleData" )
```

The xml file with the example data can be downloaded from [here](./data/emeScheme_example.xml)

## Re-import from xml into R

TODO This needs some more work #5

```{r example_import_xml, eval = FALSE}
emeScheme_gd %>%
  addDataToEmeScheme() %>%
  emeSchemeToXml( tag = "Example Data" ) %>%
  xmlToEmeScheme() %>%
  str()
```

## Presentations
* [The emeScheme - an Introduction](https://rkrug.github.io/emeScheme_Introduction/The_emeScheme.html) by Rainer M Krug. [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.2247069.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2247069)


# The R Package

The Definition of the emeScheme is done in an R package, which gives all the tools to enter the meatada and to export it into xml.

## Installation

The package is not yet on CRAN. Therefore it needs to be installed from github. This will install the last verion on github. 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## install the devtools package if not installed yet
# install.packages("devtools")

## install emeScheme from github
devtools::install_github("Exp-Micro-Ecol-Hub/emeScheme")
```

## Entering new Metadata

To enter new data to the emeScheme, you have to

```{r echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library("emeScheme")
enter_new_metadata()
```

This should open Excel and the file should look similar to this:

![](./figs/enter_new_data.png)

1) The file is read only. It needs to be saved at a different location. Therefore the template can not be changed.
2) Data can only be entered in the cells with the light grey fields with the red borders. All other cells are write protected.
3) Green rows indicate Property Names at the different levels

After entering the data, save it to alocation for further processing.

## Converting Metadata to xml

In R, you have to import the metadata and export to an xml file:

```{r  echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
x <- addDataToEmeScheme( x = "PATH/WHERE/THE/FILE/IS/file.xlsx")
emeSchemeToXml(x, file = ""PATH/WHERE/YOU/WANT/TO/HAVE/THE/FILE/file.xlm"")
```

The emeScheme data in R can be also saved, loaded, and edited using the standard R commands.

**<span style="color:red">TODO: include validation of xml against the emeScheme.xsd.xml</span>**
