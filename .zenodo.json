    "description": "<p>Metadata is essential for the managing and archiving of data. Consequentially, metadata<br>\nschemes, which standardise the property names used in specifying the metadata, play an essential role in this. Nevertheless (or because of this),&nbsp;metadata schemes are usually big, complex, difficult to read and understand,&nbsp;and, in consequence, are not used as often as they should be.<br>\n<br>\nThis package provides a framework called `dmdScheme`, which</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>&nbsp;makes it easier to develop a domain specific metadata scheme by using a spreadsheet as the base for defining the new scheme</li>\n\t<li>&nbsp; provides basic functionality for the new metadata scheme,&nbsp;including entering, validating, exporting and saving of the new metadata</li>\n\t<li>makies it easier to enter new metadata&nbsp;by using a spreadsheet to enter the new metadata which can than be imported and exported as xml</li>\n</ul>",
